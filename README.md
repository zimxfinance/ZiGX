# ZiGX Mainnet Deployment Package

This package contains the final, production-ready smart contract for the ZiGX token to be deployed on Base Mainnet.

## Purpose

ZiGX is a reserve-backed digital stable token pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. Its architecture ensures stability, transparency, and immutability through fixed-supply minting phases and auditable reserve control.

## Files

- `README.md`: This documentation.

## Deployment Notes

- Deploy using the recommended Solidity compiler version.  
- Verify contract source code on BaseScan for transparency.  
- Confirm reserve wallet and minting phases before final deployment.
